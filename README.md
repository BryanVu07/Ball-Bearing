# README - MIE243: Dissection 1, Ball Bearing

Project Overview:

Course: MIE243 – Mechanical Design  
Project: Dissection 1, Ball Bearing  
Team: 3 students per group  

This project is the first dissection assignment in the MIE243 Mechanical Design course. Our goal is to disassemble a ball bearing, accurately sketch its components, and analyze the design and material properties.

Project Objectives:
1. Hands-On Experience: 
   - Disassemble a ball bearing to explore its structure and components. This gives us practical exposure to real-world mechanisms, linking theory to tangible products.
   
2. Hand Sketching: 
   - Create a detailed hand sketch of the ball bearing, ensuring that it is dimensionally accurate and includes all major components: inner race, outer race, rolling elements, and shields (if present). The sketch will showcase at least three principle views with proper dimensioning, focusing on conveying key features of the bearing.

3. Material and Wear Analysis:
   - Identify the materials used in each sub-component. 
   - Evaluate which components are prone to wear and hypothesize their wear patterns and failure modes based on typical use cases.

4. Load Analysis:
   - Investigate the bearing's ability to handle radial and axial loads. Based on our findings, determine the types of loads the bearing can better tolerate.

5. Noise and Vibration Analysis:
   - Identify any possible sources of noise, vibration, or unwanted motion in the bearing system.

6. Measurement and Dimensional Analysis:
   - Measure the diameter of five balls from the ball bearing, and ensure that two group members independently record each measurement. The results will help assess any dimensional variances and reflect on the factors causing these discrepancies (measurement error, tool precision, or manufacturing variances).

7. Application of Findings:
   - Based on our analysis, we will determine the bearing's suitability for specific applications based on load, speed, and expected wear patterns.

Approach:

1. Dissection:
   - Carefully disassemble the ball bearing and record the dimensions of all major sub-components. Where measurements are difficult or impractical, estimations will be clearly highlighted in the final sketch.
   
2. Sketching:
   - Using hand tools, sketch the bearing in three principle views with proper dimensioning of all critical features. This will form the basis for later CAD modeling in SolidWorks.

3. Material Analysis:
   - Determine the material composition of each part and predict which components are more likely to experience wear. This analysis will include expected wear patterns and failure modes under typical conditions.

4. Load Analysis:
   - Evaluate the bearing's load tolerance and determine its ability to handle radial and axial forces. This analysis will help identify suitable applications where the bearing would perform best.

5. Noise, Vibration, and Wear:
   - Consider potential issues such as noise and vibration based on the dissection and analysis, focusing on factors like surface finish and alignment.

6. Measurement Validation:
   - Perform precise measurements of the bearing’s balls, recording separate measurements from multiple team members to ensure accuracy. We will reflect on measurement variances and learn how they might affect our future CAD models.

Conclusion:

Through this project, we aim to gain hands-on experience in mechanical dissection, develop drafting and CAD skills, and enhance our understanding of material properties and failure modes. By carefully analyzing the ball bearing's performance under various loads, we can apply this knowledge to real-world engineering challenges, ensuring better design and reliability in future projects.
